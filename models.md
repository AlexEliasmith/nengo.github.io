# Nengo models

Computational models are a vital part of research in an increasing
number of scientific domains. One difficulty with this is that
computational models are generally too complex to be fully described in
a traditional academic publication, making it hard for other researchers
to replicate and build upon existing results. This is especially true
for complex neural and cognitive models, where models can involve
simulations of millions of interacting neurons or other complex
cognitive structures.

To address this concern, and to provide additional examples for how
Nengo has been employed in a research context, we have created this
Nengo model repository. The goal is to provide enough information here
that a researcher can run the models detailed in a particular
publication or project, as well as gather and analyze the resulting
data. We also want to encourage feedback from individuals running each
others' models and to post re-implementations of each others' models.

If you are looking for simple example models for Nengo, see the
[Nengo core examples](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/examples.html).

## Add your model

If you have created a Nengo model, we want to add it to this list!
If you are not comfortable editing a reStructuredText file, please
[make a new issue on Github](https://github.com/nengo/nengo.github.io/issues/new)
telling us about your model. We may ask you a few questions
to have a complete record of your model.
